Microsoft Engage '22 Project
### Data Analysis Web Application
##
My name is Shruti Kumari, and my project is on challenge 2 to build an application that demonstrates how the Automotive Industry could harness data to make informed decisions. For my project, I made extensive use of Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I built my web application using the Streamlit Library. I used the dataset available on the acehacker website. Following that, I worked on developing my project.
##
The required libraries, along with their version names, are listed in the requirements.txt file, which has been uploaded to this repository. In addition, I have uploaded all of the files that I used while developing my application.
###
## Python Libraries Documentation
1. **MatplotLib**<br />
    pip install matplotlib
2. **NumPy**
    pip install numpy
3. **Pandas**
    pip install pandas
4. **Pillow**
    pip install Pillow
5. **Seaborn**
    pip install seaborn
6. **Streamlit**
    pip install streamlit

## How to run the Project
My project Python file name is **Automtive_Industry_1.py**, You can run the file on any IDE you pefer(I used Spyder IDE for running my file).
<br />
Once you run the file you will get an output like shown below :point_down:

<br />
Therefore in order to run the application you have follow the following stpes:
1. Open the **Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)** and change the path to where the project Python file is stored.
2. After changing the path you have to type **streamlit run Automotive_Industry_1.py**(name of the python file) as shown below :point_down:.

3. Press ENTER
<br />
This will run the application and take you to a local host provided bt #Streamlit#

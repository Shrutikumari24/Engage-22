Microsoft Engage '22 Project
### Data Analysis Web Application
##
My name is Shruti Kumari, and my project is on challenge 2 to build an application that demonstrates how the Automotive Industry could harness data to make informed decisions. For my project, I made extensive use of Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I built my web application using the Streamlit Library. I used the dataset available on the acehacker website. Following that, I worked on developing my project.
##
The required libraries, along with their version names, are listed in the requirements.txt file, which has been uploaded to this repository. In addition, I have uploaded all of the files that I used while developing my application.
